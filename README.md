##Contributions

For further development and feedback, contributions to this site are welcome. This was created in Cloud9. The link for this project can be found [here](https://ide.c9.io/flyncw85/mumford-and-sons)

##Deployment

The site was created on a Cloud 9 workspace. It was built using Bootstrap 4.0, HTML5 and CSS. The site was pushed through Github. I initially made commits and had to create a separate branch to make changes. Using the hotfix, I had to pull from master, and then "git merge" to merge the hotfix branch with the changes to my master branch and push it again successfully. 

##User Stories

- The website was simple to navigate. The previous version was not responding correctly on mobile devices and tablets. The background photo was not showing correctly on an iPhone 7plus (portrait and landscape) and on tablets. After creating media queries, the refreshed site is much cleaner. The background is a standard color on mobile devices and the font is smaller.

- The album covers are still showing differently on an iPad. After numerous attempts to try and resolve the issue with padding using media queries, I did not want to disrupt the code as it was viewing just the way I wanted it across all other devices. 

- The site is very easy to navigate and is best viewed on a desktop. The navigation dropdown tabs will navigate to the correct area of the page. It does not center on "Tour" 100% though. The page has a clear purpose as a fan page for providing basic information on the band with useful external links.



##Project Status

This is a beginning project so certain features such as the mailing list are just for testing purposes and do not function. 
I have run into issues with the background image on ipad pro screen size. I have tried using media queries, displaying the background image as fixed on the body.
